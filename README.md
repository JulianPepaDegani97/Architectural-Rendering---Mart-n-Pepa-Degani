# Architectural-Rendering---Mart-n-Pepa-Degani
Architectural renderings portfolio.
This is a project in which I used TypeScript, Vue.js, CSS3 and Bootstrap.
The reason that I decided to create it as a portfolio is because, in the future, I want to build one for my brother, a functional one.
It was made in few days, and in next versions, I pretend to implement a database, to make it more dinamic.
I took as a reference, differents webs in this area, most of those were minimalist, and very easy to use. That explains the style I gave to this project. All the information is at your fingertips, and very quickly. That was one the goals, usable for anyone.
