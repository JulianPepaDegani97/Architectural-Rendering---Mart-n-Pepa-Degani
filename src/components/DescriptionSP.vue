        The Boutique Hotel, located in San Pedro, province of Buenos Aires,
        proposes a relationship with the outside through visuals and spaces
        open.

        Through a grid, which divides the volume into equal modules, allows you
        to generate a set of solids and voids to optimize the rooms and take
        advantage of the best connection with the environment.

        The characteristic of the implantation site is its great slope, since
        that it is a ravine that is oriented to the north and with a view
        privileged towards the Rio de La Plata.

        San Pedro is perceived as a great place of green space, full of flora
        and fauna where there are great sightings of birds that attract fans
        from all over the region.

        The building manages to balance privacy and the external through blind
        and open panels.

        The rooms are located in the form of a cantilevered volume, achieving a
        lightness with its materiality. The construction system is made up by
        prefabricated industrial materials, such as steel (structure main) in
        IPN200 profiles. Mixed system, steel frame for enclosures, for easy
        assembly and construction. One of the premises was to make as little
        ground movement as possible in order to have less impact on the
        localized ecosystem.

        Access is given on the coastal avenue that runs through the entire
        canyon organically. There is a gastronomic place, access lobby, service
        and maintenance premises and administrative offices.
      </p>
      <p>
        A building with a thematic facade is sought, but one that invites the
        user to enter and continue with the prevailing horizon.
