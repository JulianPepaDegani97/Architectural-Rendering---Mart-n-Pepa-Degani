        San Vicente is a characteristic town with a traditional structure Latin
        American that is made up of a central square and around it is civic
        institutions are concentrated, such as the church, school, municipality,
        etc. The project is located precisely in this civic piece, it
        specifically abuts the existing school and historic church. The existing
        axes of these institutions were taken, generating a compressed building
        at one point in this block, managing to release the largest possible
        open space designed for the community. The project also encompasses an
        urban character, taking as an initiative to reorder the existing
        vegetation to promote meeting spaces, recreation and revaluation of the
        ecosystem.

        These spaces where you circulate through microforests adopt the native
        flora characteristic of San Vicente. The educational building
        reinterprets public education in the 21st century, since the knowledge
        is a collective construction.It is through interaction and exchange
        where this event occurs, and from this action is where the idea of ​​the
        project arises. This idea is materializes in a large vertical central
        space and unfolds in three height levels.Within this space, surrounded
        by three blocks where the pedagogical areas are found, the strength is
        focused generative of the new concept of education.Plaza Moreno, on
        street Yrigoyen, extends to our main access generating a location
        surrounded by vegetation and connects our building with the church and
        in turn, a relationship between Faith and Knowledge.That through this
        path where this experiential experience occurs. The access main lowers
        to give the user more impact and Panoramic view of the building where
        you arrive.

        A fluid route is proposed, with a secondary access on Av. San Martín,
        which gives it the character of an intern building.The project seeks
        provide San Vicente with a meeting place as well as revalue its
        identity. These concepts of encounter and identity occur together under
        a great roof that aims to unify the entire program.
      </p>
      <p>
        The building has three blocks connected to each other through
        circulations on ramps generating watertight spaces in the form of
        islands floating where the mentioned events take place. in a context as
        vulnerable as the current one, it is essential to develop activities
        both together and in open and wide spaces. the architecture must take
        reins over the traditional paradigms where the human must develop in the
        sources of knowledge, revaluing the culture and interaction between
        people. It is essential to project for a future where communication and
        contact are not lost, both with nature as with the other.
