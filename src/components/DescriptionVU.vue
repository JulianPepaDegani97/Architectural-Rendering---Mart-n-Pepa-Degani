        This project idea seeks to communicate with the users of the space
        interior as self-identity.It is from this central space that It is the
        internal patio, object and sense of the work, where the home concept.A
        common place, for the whole family, where they celebrate local
        traditions and kinship.

        The limit axes of the building that frame the land, allow generate a
        perfect spatial grid, 3 meters by 3 meters, and the same height. This
        modulation succeeded in emphasizing a game of solids and voids, where
        each mass built within the three-dimensional grid, flow different
        situations and each one compatible with the subsequent one.

        The construction system with structure in metal profiles and panels of
        concrete, make up a mixed technology allowing the possibility of future
        modifications or expansions within the modulated structure.

        This building is then conceived that encompasses all the needs of a
        typical family, spaces for study, relaxation, rest, for to share. This
        flexibility given by the user's habits influences spatial
        decision-making of the project based on generating the three-dimensional
        grid.
